**User stories**

- As a customer with an urgent need for a restroom, I want a restroom locater app because I need to find the nearest restroom.
- As a customer with unique needs, I want a filter for restrooms because I must find a restroom which fits my or my friends’ needs.
- As a customer with standards, I want user reviews because I must find restrooms which confirm to my standards of quality or service.
- As a customer with poor spatial awareness, I want a map because I need a visual indicator in order to find the restrooms nearby.
- As a busy customer, I want an accountability system for dishonest users because I don’t have the time in my day to run around being led to fake or non-quality restrooms made or rated by irresponsible users.
- As a socialite with social networking experience, I want user registration through social media accounts because it would make my registration experience simpler.
- As a discerning individual, I want a UI with a list of the nearest restrooms because having the ability to weigh multiple options is important to me.
